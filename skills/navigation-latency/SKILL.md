# Navigation Latency

Time from tap to destination screen interactive (TTI).

## Phases

```
TAP → TRANSITION → VIEW_INIT → DATA_LOAD → INTERACTIVE
     |_____________________________________________|
                   Navigation Latency
```

## When to Use

- Tab bar taps
- List item → detail screen
- Deep link → target screen
- Any screen-to-screen transition

## Key Thresholds

| Rating | Duration |
|--------|----------|
| Good | <400ms |
| Acceptable | <1s |
| Poor | >1s |

## Measurement Points

1. `onNavigationStart` - user taps (source screen)
2. `onViewAppear` - destination view visible
3. `onContentReady` - data loaded, interactive

## Implementation

See `references/ui-performance.md` (Navigation Latency section) for:
- iOS: NavigationLatencyTracker with os_signpost
- Android: Fragment/Activity lifecycle hooks
- React Native: React Navigation listeners

## Common Mistakes

- Measuring only view appear (missing data load)
- Not correlating source → destination
- Ignoring warm vs cold screen loads
