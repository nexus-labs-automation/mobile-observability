# Interaction Latency

Time from user tap to action successfully completed.

## When to Use

- "Add to cart" button tapped → cart updated
- "Submit" button tapped → form processed
- "Like" button tapped → state changed
- Any tap that triggers async work

## Measurement Pattern

```
TAP → START_SPAN → [async work] → END_SPAN
```

1. Capture tap timestamp
2. Start span with operation name
3. End span when action confirms success
4. Include success/failure outcome

## Key Thresholds

| Rating | Duration |
|--------|----------|
| Good | <300ms |
| Acceptable | <1s |
| Poor | >1s |

## Implementation

See `references/ui-performance.md` (Entry Point Latency section) for platform-specific code.

## Common Mistakes

- Ending span on API call start (not completion)
- Not tracking failure cases
- Missing the tap timestamp (starting late)
